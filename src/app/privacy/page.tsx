                    PolyHunt ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website (polyhunt.xyz) or use our mobile application (the "App").

                <h3 style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 600, marginTop: "16px", marginBottom: "8px" }}>A. Personal Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We do not natively collect directly identifiable personal information (PII) such as your real name, physical address, or phone number unless you voluntarily provide it within your public profile. When you connect a cryptocurrency wallet, we collect and store your public wallet address to authenticate you and facilitate transactions. If you choose to set up a Polyhunter profile, we may store the username, bio, avatar image, and social media links you explicitly provide.
                </p>
                <h3 style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 600, marginTop: "16px", marginBottom: "8px" }}>B. Derivative Data</h3>
                <p>
                    Our servers may automatically collect certain information when you access the App, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you view directly before and after accessing the App.
                </p>
                <h3 style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", fontWeight: 600, marginTop: "16px", marginBottom: "8px" }}>C. Blockchain Data</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the inherent public nature of blockchain technology (specifically the Solana network), all transaction data, wallet interactions, and on-chain agent rentals are permanently, publicly recorded. We do not control this blockchain infrastructure and cannot erase data from it.
